SUBIR / ACTUALIZAR FOTOS

Heck yes—you can bulk it. Here’s the clean, scalable way:

1) Put all images in your repo
Place them in img/products/

You can drag-and-drop multiple files at once in GitHub (into that folder) or do:

bash
Copy
git add img/products/*
git commit -m "Add product images"
git push
Prefer lowercase names, hyphens, no spaces. WebP/JPG ~1000px wide is perfect.
